if __name__ == "__main__":
What this does is it makes sure you are running what you want
If we have a file called xyz.py which contains 2 defined fuctions along with code which prints something out and we want to use this file as a libary  for another program
We would import it to the new file which is where the problem arises
When we import the libary ALL the code from it runs meaning if we just import it for the funcions the print statment will also run
To rectify this we would place the print code in this if __name__ == "__main__": block 
When you run the libary as a file __name__ would be "__main__" which would allow the code to run
But if we run the file which uses the libary __name__ would become the name of libary file making the if statment false allowing us to use the function we want without the unintended statments(print) running

To conclued it allow for a more controlled way of using files
It allows us to run so code if we directly run the file 


When writing a fuction or code in general you want to avoid nested fuctions as they are harder to debug 

When testing make sure to import each function individually so you know what you are testing
